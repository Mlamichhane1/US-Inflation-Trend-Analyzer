# U.S. Inflation Trend Analyzer (2010â€“2024)

This Tableau project analyzes **U.S. inflation trends** from 2010 to 2024 using official CPI data.  
It visualizes long-term inflation patterns, identifies peak and average rates, and highlights changes in the cost of living across years.

---

## Overview
The **U.S. Inflation Trend Analyzer** was built to explore how inflation has evolved over the past decade and beyond.  
By using key performance indicators (KPIs) and dynamic visualizations, the dashboard makes it easy to:
- Track **average yearly inflation** over time  
- Identify **peak inflation years** and the factors driving them  
- Understand **year-over-year (YoY)** percentage changes  
- Compare **historical vs. recent** inflation trends  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** â€” for building interactive dashboards  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** â€” for cleaning and structuring CPI data  
- **Data Source:** U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI 2010â€“2024)  
- **File Format:** `.twbx` (Tableau Packaged Workbook)

## Key Insights
- The **average inflation rate** increased significantly between 2020â€“2022 due to post-pandemic supply chain disruptions.  
- **Peak inflation** occurred in 2022, marking one of the highest year-over-year price increases in recent U.S. history.  
- A gradual **cooldown** is visible in 2023â€“2024 as monetary policies took effect.  
- Long-term inflation averages remain **above pre-pandemic levels**, suggesting persistent economic adjustment.
